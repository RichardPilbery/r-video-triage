Brief intro blurb

This service evaluation....



## Setting

YAS provides 24-hour emergency and health care services for the county of Yorkshire in the north of England. The county has a population of approximately five million, spread over almost 6000 square miles of varied terrain, included isolated moors and dales, coastline and heavily populated urban areas. In 2018/19 YAS received more than 998,500 emergency calls and responded to 798,968 incidents by either sending clinicians to scene or by providing assessment and advice over the telephone.


**Bit about setting up of the pilot. GoodSam vs Accurix**
**Clinicians calling patients back**

## Patients

Calls eligible for video triage were restricted to adults aged 18 to 65 years that had been triaged as suitable for the clinical support desk stack **(???CAT 5 ONLY????)**. However, as the pilot continued, restrictions on calls were relaxed and extended to include cateogry 2 and 3 calls and include all age ranges. Patients under the age of 16 were assessed with the consent of their parent or guardian, and consultations included in the evaluation.

## Clinicians

Bit about the clinicians themselves ? only shielding
Mean length of service perhaps?

 

## Data sources

Video consultations commenced on the 23rd March, 2020 and information about the call were recorded by clinicians participating in the pilot. Data collection was further enhanced following the involvement of the local research and developement team, and additional data was recorded by clinicians with respect to video calling both for patient and clinician to determine acceptability and impact on the assessmnet process (Supplementary 1). This enhanced data collection commenced on the 9th May 2020 and continued until the end of the pilot.

To capture the patient experience, YAS research ambassadors were consulted on the creation of a brief postal survey (Supplementary 2), which was sent to recipients of a video consultation. Surveys were sent to patients between the 11th June and 13th August, 2020. 

To determine the 24-hour re-contact rate, data were collected from the YAS 999 Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system for all ‘hear and treat’ calls and split into those that were offered and received video consultation and those that were not. A re-contact was said to have occured if a patient with the same NHS number, or same name, age, sex and incident location, called 999 in the 24-hours following on from the time of the first call.


## Statistical methods

No formal sample was calculated for this service evaluation and the analysis plan was predominantly descriptive.

### Patient experience

The patient survey consists of 7 Likert-style questions which were presented as horizontal diverging stacked bar charts (a summary table of values is available in Supplementary 3). Survey respondents also had the option to make free text comments. These were stratified into broad themes and the most commonly recurring themes reported, with examples of each provided.

Most questions were Likert-style with the additional of a free text comments section where patients could add more general comments. These were stratified into broad themes and the most commonly recurring themes reported.

### Clinician experience
The additional Likert-style questions which were added by the R&D team were analysed using horizontal diverging stacked bar charts (a summary table of values in available in Suplementary 4).

### Clinician performance

Descriptive statistics were used to report clinician call activity with simple counts and proportions stratified by video calling application (GoodSamApp or ACCuRx). A sankey diagram was utilised to demonstrate change in initial and final triage category, and final call outcome.

The difference in recontact rates of category 5 calls between video-calls and YAS-wide performance were reported as proportions, as were the rates of category 5 calls resulting in a 'hear and treat' outcome.
