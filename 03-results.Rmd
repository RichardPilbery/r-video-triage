Between 11th June 2020 and 13th August 2020, 201 postal surveys were sent to patients who were the recipient of a video triage call.`r nrow(pt_df)`/201 (`r round((nrow(pt_df)/201)*100,1)`%) were returned prior to the evaluation closing (Figure \@ref(fig:pt-likert-plot), Supplementary 3). In addition to the specific likert questions, there was an opportunity for respondents to enter a free-text comment, which was utilised in `r q8_respond$resp`/`r q8_respond$n` (`r prop_respond`%) of cases. The majority of comments praised the clinicians involved in their care, both over the phone and in person:

>"The lady I spoke to was extremely helpful and professional. I really appreciate the help she gave me regarding my six year old son. Many thanks. Second to none service."

>"The ambulance staff were absolute first class, cannot fault them in any way, a credit to the service." 

Another common thread related to the benefits of video calling over telephone-only triage, for example:

>"Thank you. It was a very helpful call in an emergency situation and was more reassuring than a telephone call." 

>"Although my technology skills are mid-range at best, I found the video call easy to manage. It also allowed the person dealing with my problem to see exactly what difficulties I was experiencing and to deal with them in the most appropriate way."

However, four respondents highlighted technical issues with the video triage service:

>"Only issue was connection / signal, very hard to hear clearly. The staff were faultless." 

>"The video kep freezing and the sound was very bad so the call did not achieve anything. So was not a satisafctory outcome."

## Summary of clinician data

Between `r format(min(df1$TimeCallCommenced), "%d %B %Y")` and `r format(max(df1$TimeCallCommenced), "%d %B %Y")`, clinicians documented `r nrow(df1)` triage calls. A video call was attempted in `r df1 %>% filter(is.na(unable)) %>% count() %>% pull(n)` (`r round((df1 %>% filter(is.na(unable)) %>% count() %>% pull(n)/nrow(df1))*100,1)`%) of cases (Table 1).

The majority of calls selected for video triage by clinicians were intially triage as category 5. However, as Figure \@ref(fig:sankey) shows, over half of calls were categorised to a higher priority by the clinician after the video consultation.
