Between 11th June 2020 and 13th August 2020, 201 postal surveys were sent to patients who were the recipient of a video triage call. `r nrow(pt_df)`/201 (`r round((nrow(pt_df)/201)*100,1)`%) were returned prior to the evaluation closing (Figure \@ref(fig:pt-likert-plot), Supplementary 3). In addition to the specific Likert questions, there was an opportunity for respondents to enter a free-text comment, which was utilised in `r q8_respond$resp`/`r q8_respond$n` (`r prop_respond`%) of cases. The majority of comments praised the clinicians involved in their care, both over the phone and in person:

>"The lady I spoke to was extremely helpful and professional. I really appreciate the help she gave me regarding my six year old son. Many thanks. Second to none service."

>"The ambulance staff were absolute first class, cannot fault them in any way, a credit to the service." 

Another common thread related to the benefits of video calling over telephone-only triage, for example:

>"Thank you. It was a very helpful call in an emergency situation and was more reassuring than a telephone call." 

>"Although my technology skills are mid-range at best, I found the video call easy to manage. It also allowed the person dealing with my problem to see exactly what difficulties I was experiencing and to deal with them in the most appropriate way."

However, four respondents highlighted technical issues with the video triage service:

>"Only issue was connection / signal, very hard to hear clearly. The staff were faultless." 

>"The video kept freezing and the sound was very bad so the call did not achieve anything. So was not a satisfactory outcome."

The majority of calls selected for video triage by clinicians were initially triaged as category 5. However, as Figure \@ref(fig:sankey) shows, over half of calls were categorised to a higher priority by the clinician after the video consultation.

```{r sankey, fig.cap="Relationship of initial and final triage category and call outcome for successful video triage calls (Note: 51 cases did not have an initial triage category reported and have been removed)"}

  knitr::include_graphics('images/sankey.png')

```


```{r}

# Quick maths to calculate proportion of recontacts for 
# cat 5
# H&T

r24 <- cat5_df %>% filter(`call outcome` == "Hear and treat") %>% count(`clinician category`) %>% rename(cc = `clinician category`)
r24a <- cat5_df %>% filter(`call outcome` == "Hear and treat") %>% count(`clinician category`, recontact) %>% rename(cc = `clinician category`)



```


An analysis of category 5 calls shows that a higher proportion of calls that were initially triaged as category 5 remained so when a video triage was conducted compared to traditional telephone triage conducted by the clinical support desk. Similarly, a higher proportion of calls had an outcome of ‘hear and treat’ when video triage was utilised (Table \@ref(tab:cat-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:csd-vs-vc)). Re-contact rates for the subset of calls with a 'hear and treat' outcome were `r r24a$n[r24a$cc == "csd" & r24a$recontact == "yes"]`/`r r24$n[r24$cc == "csd"]` (`r round((r24a$n[r24a$cc == "csd" & r24a$recontact == "yes"]/ r24$n[r24$cc == "csd"])*100,1)`%) for clinical support desk calls and `r r24a$n[r24a$cc == "video" & r24a$recontact == "yes"]`/`r r24$n[r24$cc == "video"]` (`r round((r24a$n[r24a$cc == "video" & r24a$recontact == "yes"]/ r24$n[r24$cc == "video"])*100,1)`%) for the video calls.
