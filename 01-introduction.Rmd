# Introduction {-}


The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in late 2019, and subsequent global spread has resulted in a pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The protection of healthcare staff who are at higher risk due to underlying health issues, has led to the introduction of measures designed to prevent transmission such as reduced face-to-face interactions. This has changed the way that healthcare is delivered across the world, with many health care providers introducing remote patient consultations by telephone and video [@greenhalgh_video_2020]. 

Prior to the pandemic, ambulance services managed around 6% of their 999 calls with telephone advice only, known as a ‘hear and treat’ response [@nhs_england_ambulance_2020]. In order to continue to ensure patient safety was maintained, and to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on the urgent and emergency care services during the pandemic, Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust (YAS) began to pilot video consultations for 999 calls managed by the clinical hub within the emergency operations centre (EOC). 

Previous research has focussed on the use of video consultations for routine outpatient appointments for chronic conditions and there is an absence of evidence of the effectiveness and satisfaction for patients and staff using this technology in an undifferentiated urgent or emergency case load [@greenhalgh_real-world_2018]. Recent evidence from the United States indicates that telemedicine in urgent hospital presentations provides increased capacity in the healthcare system by reducing face-to-face consultations [@mann_covid-19_2020]. However, it is important to consider the impact of this method of patient assessment and management with respect to the safety of decision making in the pre-hospital setting, patient preference and staff perceptions of the technology [@ohara_qualitative_2015].

We aimed to understand the impact of video triage by investigating patient and staff acceptability and the safety of the decision-making process.


## Objectives

Our specific objectives were:

1.	To understand the experience of patients who receive video triage as part of an episode of care arising from a 999 call.
2.	To understand the experience of ambulance staff who are involved in a patient care episode which used video triage following a 999 call.
3.	To understand the outcomes of patients who are offered video triage as determined by:
    a.	The number of patients who are offered a video consultation but refuse or do not have the technical capability
    b.	The proportion of 999 calls that are closed as ‘hear and treat’ with and without video triage
    c.	A comparison of 999 24-hour re-contact rates for video and non-video triaged calls that are closed with ‘hear and treat’ advice
